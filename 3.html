    <h1>I am a Sprinter</h1>
    <p>I ran for the track team my 7th, 9th, and 11th grade years. During these years I have always been a medium distance sprinter, ranging from 200 meters to 800 meters each track meet. Those years have always been the best for me because I was given the
      opportunity to run with my friends and stay fit at the same time.</p>
    <h1>I am involved in Coding</h1>
    <p>I just picked up coding after a friend told me I should join the class. So far I have very little experience but I'm hoping this year I am at least able to learn how to do front end development if the need ever arises.</p>
    <h1>I sing in the School Honours Choir</h1>
    <p>Not only do I sing, but I have made the <em>All-West Honours Choir</em> in my 7th-9th grade years with the middle school choir, and 10th grade being with the high school choir as bass 2. It was always a great honour to be able to participate in, and
      even though I've moved on to other things these performances forged memories and friendships I'll never forget!</p>
